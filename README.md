# Emergency_Readmission
ML model to predict the emergency re-admission of the patients.
Here we need to Create a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient being admitted to the Emergency Room (ER) within the next "N" days, using historical medical and patient data. 

To solve this problem statement, we will follow a structured approach that includes the following steps:

1. Data Preparation and Exploration:

a) Load and understand the dataset.
b) Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.
c) Handle missing values, outliers, and data preprocessing.

2. Feature Engineering:

a) Create new features that may be relevant for predicting ER visits.
b) Engineer features that capture temporal trends, patient history, or other relevant factors.

3. Machine Learning Model Building:

a) Split the data into training and testing sets.
b) Train and evaluate different machine learning models for classification.
c) Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

4. Explanations for Predictions:

a) Implement model interpretability techniques to explain the predictions made by the selected model.
