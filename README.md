# Emergency_Readmission
ML model to predict the emergency re-admission of the patients.
The problem statement is: "Create a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient being admitted to the Emergency Room (ER) within the next "N" days, using historical medical and patient data. 
To solve this problem statement, we will follow a structured approach that includes the following steps:

Data Preparation and Exploration:

Load and understand the dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.
Handle missing values, outliers, and data preprocessing.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that may be relevant for predicting ER visits.
Engineer features that capture temporal trends, patient history, or other relevant factors.
Machine Learning Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train and evaluate different machine learning models for classification.
Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Explanations for Predictions:

Implement model interpretability techniques to explain the predictions made by the selected model.
